For the folder with files we want to start a repository on and right click on it, then select "Git Bash Here"

A Git Bash window will open which looks like a command prompt. It will be ready to take commands for the folder desired

The following are command lines that can be ran

git init
	this will initialize the repository for the folder, which allows us to start using git repository commands

touch notes.txt
	this will initialize a file called notes.txt

git config --global user.name 'Tai Nguyen'
	adds user name to git, likely for logging purposes

git config --global user.email 'tai959328@gmail.com'
	add user email to git, likely for logging purposes

git add notes.txt
	this adds the file to the staging area (aka index), which is the place changed files stay before they are committed locally

git status
	check to see what is in the staging area

git rm --cached notes.txt
	removes notes.txt from the staging area

git add *.txt
	adds any txt files into the staging area

git add .
	adds every file in the folder to the staging area
	if we add files then save updates to those files while they are in the staging area, we'll get notification of changes that
	aren't staged when we check the staging area. Adding the files into the staging area again will stage the latest saved files


	After commiting the changes we will have cleared the staging area
